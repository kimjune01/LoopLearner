## Core Evaluation Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- **Perplexity**: Fundamental metric for measuring an LLM's ability to predict the next word in a sequence
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Measure correctness against ground truth using precision, recall, and F1 scores
- **Lexical Similarity**: Assess text matching using BLEU or ROUGE scores for word overlap
- **Correction-to-Completion Ratio (CCR)**: Most reliable metric for production use cases - measures accuracy and effectiveness in providing correct information

### Quality Metrics

- **Fluency**: Assesses naturalness and grammatical correctness of generated text
- **Coherence**: Analyzes logical flow and consistency of ideas
- **Factuality**: Evaluates accuracy of information provided, especially in information-seeking tasks

### Fairness & Safety Metrics

- **Demographic Parity**: Ensures consistent performance across different demographic groups
- **Equal Opportunity**: Validates even error distribution across groups
- **Toxicity Detection**: Ensures safe handling of sensitive topics and harmful content

## The CLASSic Framework

Enterprise standard framework by Aisera for benchmarking AI agents across 5 dimensions:

1. **Cost**: Operational expenses including API usage, tokens, and infrastructure
2. **Latency**: End-to-end response time for task execution
3. **Accuracy**: Precision of workflow selection and execution
4. **Stability**: Robustness across different inputs, domains, and operational conditions
5. **Security**: Resistance to adversarial inputs, prompt injection, and data leaks

## Automated Prompt Optimization

### APO (Automatic Prompt Optimization)

Creates recursive feedback loops through:

1. Collecting errors from current prompt on training data
2. Summarizing errors via natural language gradient
3. Generating modified prompt versions using the gradient
4. Selecting the best edited prompt
5. Repeating the process iteratively

### PromptWizard (Microsoft Research)

- Open-source tool for automated prompt optimization
- Combines iterative LLM feedback with efficient exploration
- Creates highly effective prompts in minutes
- Integrates refinement techniques for rapid optimization

## Human-in-the-Loop Best Practices

### Preference Feedback

- Easier for users to provide
- Better suited for practical applications

### Integration Points

- **Annotation Queues**: Systematic human feedback collection
- **Customer Research**: Direct integration with user feedback
- **Qualitative Data**: Incorporation of nuanced human insights
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Essential for high-stakes applications in healthcare, finance, and legal services

## Evaluation Frameworks for 2025

### Open Source Tools

## A/B Testing Best Practices

### Evaluation-Driven Development

1. Create comprehensive dataset of inputs and expected outputs
2. Define clear evaluation metrics
3. Test each prompt change against the dataset
4. Score outputs systematically
5. Ensure improvement or prevent regression

### Iterative Optimization Workflow

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Run initial prompt to get baseline scores
2. **Iterative Testing**: Loop through training dataset examples
3. **Scoring**: Evaluate all examples with defined metrics
4. **Feedback Integration**: Use LLM-based suggestions for improvements
5. **Validation**: Test on development split to confirm improvements

## Production Monitoring

### Key Components

- **Real-time Logging**: Capture all LLM calls, prompts, and responses
- **Metadata Tracking**: User feedback, session IDs, and context
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Automated scoring pipeline
- **Metric Aggregation**: Roll up performance indicators for dashboards

### Safety Features

- Built-in guardrails for content safety
- Fallback models for reliability
- Regression testing to prevent degradation
- Security monitoring for adversarial inputs

## Advanced Techniques
